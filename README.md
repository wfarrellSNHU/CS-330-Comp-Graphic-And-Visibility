# CS-330-Comp-Graphic-And-Visibility

I approach designing software based on what's needed to accomplish developing the features and then the data involved with the features.  By taking this approach you then know basically a high level system component idea as well as any data needs required.  UML is a great approach to this with object models and system components and then putting the two together by createing sequence diagrams.  This approach is usally the same regardless of the techniology being used to engineer the features.

I followed the same process as described for our project in this class.  I took more of a modular approach rather than an object oriented one for this class implementing OpenGL API.  However, I kept to a strict funtional programming paradigm just as most of the resource examples followed from both Learn OpenGL as well as the Class GitHub code walkthroughs.

I ensured first that my models were created by setting the values in the VBO and VAO and then ensured they worked with the shaders that we developed.  Next I added textures and lastly lighting to make the scren come togheter.  It was a very iterative approach that anyone can follow by building upon each previous step.

For the future of my career, I'm not entirely sure if I would ever be able to use OpenGL on a project with my current job.  However, I would love to expand these skills by learning more for a personal goal.  I would love to learn 3D modeling with Blender and be able to export a file of the model data to load into my own OpenGL and work with it.
